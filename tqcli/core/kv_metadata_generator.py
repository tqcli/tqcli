"""Generate turboquant_kv.json metadata via activation-based calibration.

Mirrors the vLLM-turboquant fork's own reference selector,
`vllm.v1.attention.ops.turboquant_kv_cache.build_turboquant_outlier_masks`,
which scores each channel by the mean-squared activation across tokens and
picks the top-`outlier_count` indices per KV head. This module accumulates the
same statistic online over a calibration corpus and writes the resulting
per-layer, per-head outlier indices to `turboquant_kv.json` in the model
directory.

Design rationale:
    Pre-computed metadata is higher quality than runtime first-batch auto
    calibration (more prompts → tighter variance estimate, reproducible
    across servers). We capture POST-RoPE K (since the KV cache stores
    post-RoPE keys) and V (no RoPE on values) at bf16 precision with CPU
    offload to fit small-VRAM hosts.

Refused cases:
    - Pre-quantized source weights (AWQ, GPTQ, bnb): activation statistics
      from quantized weights are biased by the weight quantization, not the
      true FP distribution the runtime will see.
    - Variable head_dim within a model (Gemma 4 style sliding/global).
    - head_dim not a multiple of 16.
    - Architectures without a registered capture wrapper.
